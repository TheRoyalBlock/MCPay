# MCPay
A new way to pay in Minecraft - MCPay, a registered trademark of Lewis Brindley Developing Private.

MCPay was a visual dream of many developers who didn't quite agree with the normal way Minecraft Payment system was working, especially so that only Partnered Servers had access to it. For such a reason, MCPay was created and provides a way to allow users to pay and Minecraft Server owners to raise funds for their hardware and staff.
